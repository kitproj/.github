Kitproj has a singular goal: to make software engineers work more productive.

Principles:

- **Easy To Use**. Install by pasting one or two lines of bash.
- **Zero runtime dependenciess**. Like `jq`, packaged as a single standalone binary with no need to install Node, Python or Java.
- **Tiny**. The binaries are typcially less than 10mb. Any images are typcially based on scratch.
- **Fast**. Tools start in under one second.
- **Frugal** . Each tool typcially uses only a few MB of memory, and single-digit percentages of a CPU.
- **Secure**. Zero or minimal dependencies, and automated security updates.
